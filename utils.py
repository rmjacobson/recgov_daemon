    Set logging for whole project. This function is called from wherever the program
    is invoked. Could be from different places given development of different components
    separately.

    Note on logging:
    Python 3 logging is annoyingly confusing because of how inheiritance from the root logger works
    and how multiple modules all need to log to the same file. It's also annoying that no tutorial
    or official doc agrees on what is "best practice" between manually naming the loggers across
    modules vs. using __name__, or whether or not it's best practice to create config/ini files, etc.

    For this project, I have chosen to programatically configure logging as below, using basicConfig
    to also reconfigure the root logger (which affects Selenium mostly), and have other modules get
    configs from here by just using getLogger in those files because it is the simplest thing I've
    tried that actually works as needed. The log:
    - is set to INFO by default
    - rotates to a new file every day
    - will save logs for 7 days max
    - saves to a local logs/ directory inside this repo (excluded from git) because doing so
        elsewhere does not guarantee user will have permissions to create files
